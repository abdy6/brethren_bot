# brethren_bot
Dubai Brethren Discord bot. This is a joke project.

## General
- `ping`: See if the bot is online.
- `echo [message]`: Repeats the message passed by the user.
- `uptime`: Get the bot uptime and start time.
- `avatar [user]`: Show the specified user's avatar. If left empty, will show your avatar.
- `timeat <city>`: Show the current time for the specified city. The command
  caches both your query and the resolved location to avoid geocoding mistakes.

## Server Configuration
- `setlogchannel [channel]`: Set the channel the bot should use for logging deleted messages.
- `ignorechannel [channel]`: Toggle whether a channel should be ignored by the logger.
- `ignoredchannels`: List ignored channels for this server.

## Fun
TBD
